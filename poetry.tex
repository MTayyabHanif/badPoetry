\section*{Preface}

This is my first book of poems. It is a collection of poems I wrote
between the ages of 12 and 21. No attempt has been made to edit or
improve them in any way other than typesetting.

The purpose of joining them together in this format is to provide
practice with the \LaTeX\ typesetting environment, so that I may be
better prepared for future publishing endeavors.

\section*{Ronald McDonald is on the lam}
\begin{verse}
Ronald McDonald is on the lam \\
He took out a Berringer\\
emptied the register\\
and told all the kiddies to scram.\\[8pt]

He left in a flash of red, white, face painted\\
removed clown shoes over sneakers; (cunning\\
knew that those clunkers were never for running)\\
as baffled parent onlookers fainted.\\[8pt]

When the police arrived with blue lights flashing\\
interviewed eyewitnesses and given the news\\
the physical evidence was a pair of clown shoes\\
many of the cops couldn't keep from laughing.\\[8pt]

They were thinking about the press release\\
the Hamburglar might finally get some good spin\\
or character witness Grimace might be brought in\\
but in fact they found only Mayor McCheese.\\[8pt]

The manager intoned it was serious business\\
to have your own mascot-a simple clown-\\
rob you blindly-in public-in such a quiet town!\\
Ron had better pray for forgiveness.\\[8pt]

The weeks passed on, and the years\\
the mark on reputation the executives despised\\
perhaps he was himself, the perfect disguise\\
and in children he instilled new fears.\\[8pt]

Clown robbery started sweeping the nation-\\
in Waukegan, then Flint, Bilouxi and Reno,\\
(then even in places without a casino!)\\
-because it beats knocking an armored gas station.\\[8pt]

Soon it became an international scam\\*
instead of some corporate promo\\*
the effect was business in slow-mo\\*
Ronald McDonald is still on the lam.\\[8pt]

\section*{an email conversation}
\begin{verse}
\texttt{To: sfmeteo@bellpac.net}\\
\texttt{Subject:} address confirmation\\[8pt]
Seth,\\
Is your address\\
still Box 6497?\\[5pt]
Felicia Casey\\[2cm]

Felicia,\\
i know it is difficult\\
to understand how others\\
perceive you sometimes but\\
do I look like someone\\
who could live in a box?\\[5pt]

\section*{The second law}

\begin{verse}
\begin{center}
Innumerable events happen \textsc{simultaneously}\\
galaxies move away from one another as the\\
universe expands even though it is unknown\\
whether or not the universe is a closed system\\
and how much mass it has, if it will or not\\
collapse in on itself or become \textsc{uniform}, boring\\
constant temperature or pressure throughout\\
or maybe trade its disorder disguised as some\\
gift a bomb but one death is all entropy gives off\\
unusable energy otherwise known as waste, refuse\\
heat from an array number of useless conveniences\\
collisions between silver \textsc{pellets} bounce away\\
attracted to one another by some false gravity\\
simulated inside a giant supercomputer of the\\
future itself dumping out energy in cycles millions\\
per-picosecond where order is steadily decreasing as\\
temperature still rises and over which calculated is\\
the entropy our old friend and former enemy, stalemate\\
baffling us teaching us and befriending us fighting\\
while the pepper plant still inches up\\
\textsc{grasping} to wrap itself around the sun.\\
\end{center}
\end{verse}

\section*{November Rumination}
\begin{verse}
Sitting on the first day of August\\
oppressive heat hangs like stale coffee\\
at the bottom of a moldy cup\\
and insects celebrate like a parade of\\
electric razors in our swamped back yard.\\[10pt]

Its hard not to think of that first chill day\\
in November, when the fast wind threatens\\
to freeze and chill and take your bones away\\
until you find the loving tall loving girl\\
in her loving tall loving blue sweater.\\[12pt]

Embrace her.\\
She is warmth.
\end{verse}
\newpage

\section*{Galaxies Collide}
\begin{verse}
It'll never happen, they say\\
the odds are a google to one\\
and even if it did, they say\\
it would take a trillion years or more\\[12pt]

pity I can't stick around for it.\\[12pt]

Its so unlikely, that we're\\
a billion times more likely\\
to destroy our own selves in: nuclear war\\
ecological disaster, global warming, overgrazing,\\
or maybe in a 3 billion car pileup on the giant\\
singular super-mega-highway of the future\\[12pt]

or choked to death by our own fart gases.\\[12pt]

However reassuring,\\
even if it did happen,\\
and if it happened to us,\\
we wouldn't collide, they say,\\
our system would float independent, into space\\
there'd just be no more Milky Way\\[12pt]

such a shame. I do love chocolate bars.
\end{verse}

\section*{I hate fingers.}
\begin{verse}
Fingers are for getting pinched.\\
Fingers are for touching hot stoves during friendly conversations.\\
$\ldots$\\
Everyday fingers are getting smashed by ball-pine hammers, crushed up in doorjambs, doing mathematics, and generally scheming to make our lives miserable.\\
$\ldots$\\
While we push on and try to complete the work of our lives.\\
\end{verse}
\newpage

\section*{A logical consequence}
\begin{verse}
Within any statement,\\
formed ``If P then Q,''\\
P is the antecedent;\\
when P is false\\
the whole thing is true!

That means that if P is true,\\
the consequent (which is Q)\\
is the whole bundled-hellofit\\
BUT if P is false,\\
the whole thing's irrelevant!

So if you want me now,\\
then I'll crawl into your pants.\\
And if you're the king of England,\\
then I am the Queen of France!
\end{verse} \newpage

\section*{Klein Bottle Limericks}
\begin{tabbing}
\quad\=\kill
There once was a man named Klein\\
who thought his new bottle divine\\
\>when asked ``How's it fare?''\\
\>he said ``fine for air,\\
but I wouldn't suggest it for wine!''\\[12pt]

A man once bought a Klein bottle\\
the purchase a monet'ry foddle.\\
\>While requesting a refund\\
\>the bottle would have fun\\
and shivel and teedle and tottle.\\[12pt]

In the playground Klein mended\\
the crawl tubes were bended\\
\>To crawl all around it\\
\>the kids were confounded\\
to find that the thing never ended!\\[12pt]

There once was a man so vain\\
to have surgery just to stay sane\\
\>instead of physicians\\
\>he saw mathematicians\\
his insides will now channel rain!\\[12pt]

There once was an invert of skinside.\\
His yang-side was partly his yin-side.\\
\>when asked about locus,\\
\>he said ``its hard to keep focus\\
when your inside's your outside's your insides.''\\[12pt]

Driving a car made by Klein\\*
is an experience almost divine\\*
\>--the highways are fare\\*
\>when the outside's in there--\\*
well, except for high winds it is fine.\\*[12pt]

\section*{``pulp.''}
\begin{verse}
Go find a set of ballpoint pens, identical\\
only that one is blue and one is red\\
set them out an inch apart from one another.\\
And go get two same oranges and pair of wine glasses\\
tainting and distorting them to uniform tints\\
of bored red and blue, painting away details.\\
Arrange the real genuine tangible stuff so that it\\
looks like two abstract intangible messes\\
mirroring each other in two hues on the floor.\\
but be SURE to get identical twins. essential\\
honest-to-god people, both subject and observer\\
but cover one in each color, head-to-toe plain,\\
hiding all but three characteristic flaws.\\
Draw an X on the floor.\\
Finally, get someone to stand there like Wil-E-Cayote\\
wearing the pair of phoney 3D-movie glasses and gaping.

\section*{on a morning just as perfect for tea}
\begin{verse}
In the darkness before the sun tilts upward\\
before the plants continue their slow growth\\
while the moon walks again across my kitchen window\\
I am in a private still world of humid cool.\\[12pt]

The stove lights and warms with a steady woof.\\
The reassuring pungent smell of gas unburned\\
with flickering new blue artificial flame\\
 fills the tiny world I inhabit with strange warmth.\\[12pt]

The ancient sun becomes jealous of this new flame,\\
and with slow strict love, like the love of a father,\\
vies the moon away and fills my kitchen with orange envy\\
touching a sack of dried onions in the window.\\[12pt]

I put the kettle on,\\
in a programmed and routine movement,\\
and soon it begins its slow meditative approach,\\
gently hissing a soothing morning song.\\[12pt]

with no less haste popping popping\\
sizzling whishing wanting calling\\
screaming fizzing fipping crying\\
wanting to be let loose of the flame.\\[12pt]

I too would cry boiling tears\\
if I were a kettle with the flame to my back\\
heated beyond need to be heated\\
the only option left the slow phase change into vapors.\\[12pt]

I poured the water into the teapot.\\
I poured the tea into my cup.\\
I poured tea down my gullet.\\[12pt]

The tea became me as I watched the sun slowly rise,\\
and knew too, that it had become me, and I would become it\\
on a morning just as perfect for tea, as perfect for myself.\\
\end{verse}
\newpage

\section*{the last beer}
\begin{verse}
I caught myself asking me\\
if I should drink the last beer.\\

``Of course you should''\\
I told myself,\\
``if a tree falls on you\\
or if you are drafted and go to war,\\
or should hurricane or nuclear war come,\\
there will always be more beer.''\\[1in]

So true.
\end{verse}
\newpage

\section*{Squat thing}
\begin{verse}
What are you, squat thing,\\
A stand for ambitious plants?\\
A table for tea, on the floor\\
or for playing go with friends\\
in the Japanese style,\\
legs crossed on numbered Tatami?\\[12pt]

Are you a stool,\\
assisting the stout and weak hearted\\
elderly and just beginning\\
in learning that they can be tall and total?\\
Are you a singular shelf,\\
Lonesome, lonely, and alone\\
away from friends' company\\
aspiring for some social order?\\[12pt]

Could you be any number of things?\\
Could you be whatever I want of you?\\
A racecar, or a rocket ship, or something even as abstract\\
as a source of inspiration\\
or as dull as a piece of furniture.\\
A mere object?\\[12pt]

--No, a platform to build upon my hopes and aspirations.\\
That is what you are. And so long as I expect so much from you,\\
You simply don't exist.\\[12pt]
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}

thats why im a wallflower--no television!\\
this one she makes unknown things for lockheed and\\
that one he drills oil off the south coast and\\
this one he makes junk mail more appealing and\\
that one she convinces people to consolidate debts\\
and not one who seems to give a damn about anything.

\section*{Mo-ped}
\begin{verse}
Will let me ride his Mo-ped.\\
MOtor. PEDal.\\
Sixties schwinn with a motor beauty, 50 cc;\\
I would make sure it got up to 45.\\
After all, I did help him build it.\\[10pt]

We hitched it onto my car and took it into the safer\\
MOre GENtle\\
Countryside,\\
where it would be safer to ride.\\
After all, I did have some say in the matter.\\[10pt]

It was a terrible day in May\\
HEat INDex\\
topping higher than I can count on such a day\\
comfortable out in the shade of a pine tree\\
the red frame shines as a pine cone smarts my shoulder, falling.\\[10pt]

Wills ride was short and uncelebrated,\\
ROte COMPetence\\
He displayed on his mild mile journey back between rows of pines.\\
His golden hair blown back inside a wind tunnel of his own throttle.\\
My ride would not be so cautious, on a bike and body not my own.\\[10pt]

I put the throttle up,\\
PAst CARElessness\\
My hair swept back in a receding hairline toward death's welcome\\
I slid away from sanity, many miles, too far to risk\\
And there came a hot snarled rattling against my leg.\\[10pt]

The muffler was loose,\\*
HOT CHROme\\*
I had no tools to fix it, and FINGERTIPS became scorched,\\*
I had gone to far to pedal back. I cut the engine back on,\\*
Apologizing as I collected and reassembled the pieces of his broken machine.

\section*{God wanders in}
\begin{verse}
God wanders in\\
and mockingbird, perched\\
on the open windowsill\\
turns its head in contempt.\\
I am merely a mortal, and it\\
too knows mortality,\\
a smidgen of black bile and\\
undigested worm peeks\\
from its sharp and thorny beak.\\
I can see its age in the\\
rustle of its tattered feathers\\
one, grey, slowly falls to the floor,\\
it shoots a clump of sick liquid.\\
God is a mockingbird\\
graceful but diseased.\\

\section*{Mosquito}
\begin{verse}
Blister me from chin to toenail\\
smacking frustration through my sunveil\\
Ankle-biters, armpit connoisseurs\\
their dinner is worse than our sewers\\
(me, being herbivore non-carnivore-or-omnivore\\
am nothing beside a dreary arachnid, insectivore).\\[14pt]

I carry a decoy\\
(bugs can't see a ploy)\\
blow up doll filled With V8\\
(bugs can't smell blood from great)\\
they take the trap, pierce rubber with labium\\
(bugs can't feel dermis from vulcanum)\\
certainly I'm no entomolinerian, but\\
Now they're the Bastard Vegetarians!\\

O to see you in Geology\\

in your plum rains blood rains or acid rains\\
rare emotion of desert storms in your eclipsing eyes\\
penumbra a diamond and cool corroded quartz of insight.\\[12pt]

Seldom tears race through your Arroyo\\
and collect flashflood at the basin\\

How do you praise the wind\\
